# Trello-KPI

This project was completed during an internship at Inventive Works in Austin, TX.
I moved the front-end code to this repository, so that I could connect it to an active trello board.
The back-end can be seen at https://github.com/camilothomas/interns-oct2018

It was a collaborative project worked on by myself and two other interns named Thinh Vu and Roslyn Ramirez.
